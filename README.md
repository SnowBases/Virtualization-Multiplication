To-do
----------
The algorithms works well for the row `int[] A = getArrays("99");` but 
the 'row' cant be more than 2 digits because there is a miscalculation at the symetrical part.

However, for the `column` part which is `int[] B = getArrays("2147483647");` is TESTED and the output is so far good.

What need to be improve
- The row which is `int[] A = getArrays("99");` cant be more than 2. 
- if row and column 1 digits only, the program will show the incorrect output.

Changelog
----------
1. 2018-11-14- v1.0.0 - Initial first algorithms (need to improve)
